## Extend the “About Me” project

### I build an app so people can know me better using the "Guessing Game". It asks the user to answer some questions about me so she or he can know how much they know me. Using html/ css/ JS, it first asks by using prompt then displays if the answer is correct or wrong, after that the webpage will be displyed with a bio and the correct answers for the quesions.

### Then the user will get text-answer questions and she/he has to answer them, after that an alert will be displayed to tell them if they answered correctly or not.

### In the end the user will get a score which is the number of correct answers.

### The HTML page will include the answers of the questions, a biography and a top 10 page.
